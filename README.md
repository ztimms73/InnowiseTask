# Weather application
				
Create a simple Android app for weather forecasting. It should show the actual weather for your current location. 

# Minimal functionality:

- In the forecast tab, show the forecast for the next 5 days (in 3 hour intervals) at your current location
-	Make sure you consider and handle all possible states of the app (offline, data not loading, errors, etc) 

# Use:

- [x] Kotlin
- [x]	Make the layout responsive for all screen sizes your app supports
- [x]	Min API Level: 21
- [x]	MVP (Use this pattern to create application structure)
- [x]	Open Weather Map API (http://openweathermap.org/api)
- [x]	Geolocation for determining the current position of the device
- [x]	RxJava for async operations
- [x]	Material Design Guidelines + Material Design Icon
- [x]	Use the design for the application
- [x]	Share weather as text

# Result:

-	Code should be published to a public repository on GitHub
-	Repository should contains commit history instead of single one
-	Select icons by yourself. App should contain non-default launch icon
-	Link should be provided to interviewer.
